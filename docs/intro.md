# Introduction

Welcome to Zexcore, your solution for real-time communication and logging functionality tailored for React/ReactNative and NodeJS applications. Zexcore empowers developers with a suite of libraries and SDKs that facilitate seamless communication between apps and servers, leveraging the power of Redis and WebSocket API. This documentation will guide you through the features and usage of Zexcore SDKs, allowing you to enhance your applications with real-time capabilities and robust logging functionality.

## Features

- Real-time Communication: Zexcore enables real-time communication between applications and servers, leveraging Redis and WebSockets API for efficient data exchange.

- Logging Functionality: Zexcore provides comprehensive logging functionality for apps, with real-time logs displayed on the Zexcore Web Application, ensuring developers have immediate visibility into application activities.

- Support for React/ReactNative and NodeJS Applications: Zexcore is designed to seamlessly integrate with React, ReactNative, and NodeJS applications, catering to a wide range of development environments.

- Scalability: With Redis at its core, Zexcore is inherently scalable, making it easy to handle growing demands and large user bases without compromising performance.

- Remote Procedures: Zexcore's Real-Time Messaging (RTM) APIs mimic Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), enabling clients to invoke functions on the server and receive results asynchronously, enhancing application interactivity and responsiveness.

## Getting Started

### RTM Server `@zexcore/rtm-server`

The RTM Server SDK empowers developers to implement real-time RPC-like function calling on servers. By integrating the RTM Server SDK into your backend infrastructure, you can enable seamless communication between clients and servers, enhancing the real-time capabilities of your applications.

### RTM Client `@zexcore/rtm-client`

The RTM Client SDK enables developers to interact with registered RPC functions on the RTM Server. By integrating the RTM Client SDK into your client-side codebase, you can leverage the power of real-time communication to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of your applications.

### Analytics SDK `@zexcore/analytics`

The Analytics SDK provides essential analytics and logging functions that are directly integrated with Zexcore's Web Application. By incorporating the SDK into your application, you can gain insights into application activities in real-time, facilitating effective debugging and monitoring.
